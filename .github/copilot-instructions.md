This project is a local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application using Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Chroma, and Ollama. It is designed to run fully locally, be free, and provide a chat interface over ingested documents. All code should be CPU-friendly and easy to run on a Windows machine with 16GB RAM. Prioritize simplicity, performance, and local-first design.
